## Code Description:
The assets folder conatins the pictures of the recipes, logo of the website and website icon.

The css folder has the main.css which contains all designing properties of the elements that you can view on the website for example, the text colour, button orientations, navigation toolbar settings, margins, photo size, header and footer, label button formats and the like.

## Why I chose this topic...
I love to cook and try out new kinds of cuisines and it made me think that maybe some people are missing out on the diverse cuisine that Indian food has to serve, so I decided to take up the topic of making a recipe website. My mother is a wonderful cook too and these are her recipes that her great-grandmother taught her, so they are authentic in the best way possible. I am very happy with the way the wesite turned out and I definitely plan on expanding my horizons in the area of coding to create something much more complex and efficient in the future.
