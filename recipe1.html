                Take a bowl and add the marination ingredients such as yoghurt, minced garlic,
                grated ginger, garam masala, turmeric powder, cumin powder, red Kashmiri chilli
                powder and salt. Mix the ingredients and add the chicken pieces. Coat them well
                in the mixture. Let the chicken rest for 10 minutes. You can also marinate the

              <p>
                Take a large skillet pan. Add oil and heat it on medium flame. Add the chicken
                pieces and fry each side for 3 minutes until they turn golden brown. Make sure
                to add two or three pieces only at a time.

                In the same pan, melt the butter. Add onions and saut√© them until they turn
                golden brown. Scrape any bits that are stuck to the bottom of the pan. Add
                ginger, garlic, and saut√© for a few minutes. Then add cumin powder, turmeric
                powder, and coriander powder and garam masala. Mix until fragrant. Then add the
                tomato puree, chilli powder and salt. Let the gravy simmer for 10-15 minutes.
                Add the cream and sugar and stir the mixture.

                Once the gravy thickens, add the chicken pieces and its juices. Cook for 8-10
                minutes or until the chicken is cooked thoroughly. If needed, pour little water
                if the sauce is too thick. Take the pan off the stove. Let it rest. Then garnish
                with coriander leaves and serve hot with basmati rice.
